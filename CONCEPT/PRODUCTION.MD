Production:

Batch Production:

Inputs of type X,Y,Z in quantity x,y,z,
with outputs of type I,J,K with quantity i,j,k.

Interruption leads to waste of inputs.

Continuos production:

Production may be interrupted at any point and still result in outputs.


Non-linear production:

Stochastic production:

Production has a risk of failing

Output or tie may vary

Efficiency dependent on batch size
